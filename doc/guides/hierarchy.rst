Hierarchy
=========

In Vivarium, we combine processes and stores to form compartments as
shown in panel B below. These compartments are in turn nested to form
the model :term:`hierarchy`, depicted in panel C.

.. figure:: ../_static/compartment.png
   :width: 100%
   :align: center
   :alt: A figure with 3 panels lettered A through C. In panel A, we see
       a red database symbol labeled "store" and with the text
       "variable values, units, mass, children, emitters, dividers,
       updaters" within it. Below, a yellow rectangle labeled "process"
       contains the text "variable names, parameters, mechanisms." A
       black line extending from the rectangle is labeled "port". In
       panel B, we see a blue square labeled "compartment". Inside are
       two stores and two processes, with the lower store connected to
       the ports of both processes, and the upper store connected only
       to the top process. A store outside the square labeled "boundary"
       is connected to a port of the upper process. In panel C, 4
       compartments form a tree with one compartment at the top level
       and one at the bottom level. The tree's edges are formed by black
       lines to boundary stores.

   The relationships between stores, processes (panel A), and
   compartments (panel B) in the tree (panel C).

Note that in panel C, only the compartments and boundary stores are
shown. The full hierarchy also contains the stores and processes within each
compartment.

Hierarchy Structure
-------------------

In the example below, we print out the full hierarchy as a dictionary.

>>> from vivarium.experiments.glucose_phosphorylation import (
...     glucose_phosphorylation_experiment,
... )
>>> from vivarium.core.experiment import Compartment, Experiment
>>> from vivarium.library.pretty import format_dict
>>>
>>>
>>> experiment = glucose_phosphorylation_experiment()
>>> print(format_dict(experiment.state.get_config()))

            "_value": 2.0
        },
        "G6P": {
            "_default": 0.0,
            "_emit": true,

        },

        "_updater": "<function update_set>",
        "_value": "<vivarium.processes.tree_mass.TreeMass object>"
    }
}

We can represent this hierarchy graphically like this:

.. image:: ../_static/hierarchy.png
   :width: 100%
   :align: center
   :alt: A tree with root node "root". The root has children "cell",
       "global", "injector", "glucose_phosphorylation", and
       "my_deriver". The node "cell" has children "ATP", "ADP", "HK",
       "GLC", and "G6P". The node "global" has children "initial_mass"
       and "mass".

.. todo:: This hierarchy figure is ugly. Fix it.

Notice that in the dictionary above, each leaf node in the tree is a key
with a value that is a dictionary of :term:`schema keys`.

---------------
Hierarhcy Paths
---------------

A hierarhcy in Vivarium is like a directory tree on a filesystem. In
line with this analogy, we specify nodes in the hierarchy with paths.
Each path is a tuple of node names (variable names or store names)
relative to some other node. For example, in the topology from the
example above, we used the path ``('cell', )`` to say that the ``cell``
store maps to the injector's ``internal`` :term:`port`. This path was
relative to the compartment root (``root`` in our diagram) as is the
case for all topologies. Thus the path is analogous to ``./cell`` in a
directory.

Special Symbols
===============

Continuing our analogy between hierarchy paths and file paths, the
following symbols have special meanings in hierarchy paths:

* ``..`` refers to a parent node. One example use for this is a division
  process that needs to access the parent (environment) compartment to
  create the daughter cells. In fact, this is what we do in the growth
  and division compartment:
  :py:class:`vivarium.compartments.growth_division`.
* ``*`` is a wild-card that refers to all the children of a node. For
  example, ``(*, )`` in our topology example above would refer to the
  ``cell`` and ``global`` stores, as well as the ``injector``,
  ``glucose_phosphorylation``, and ``my_deriver`` processes. **Note
  that wild-cards don't make sense in topologies!** We just used it here
  to explain how they work. One example use for wild-cards is in the
  mass deriver, which uses it to sum masses throughout the hierarchy:
  :py:class:`vivarium.processes.tree_mass.TreeMass`.
