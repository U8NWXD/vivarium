Welcome to Vivarium's documentation!
====================================

Vivarium is a multiscale platform for simulating cells in dynamic
environments, within which they can grow, divide, and thrive.

Introduction
------------

A vivarium, literally a "place of life," is a controlled environment in
which organisms can be studied. You might have encountered examples of
vivaria like an aquarium or a terrarium. The Vivarium project provides a
framework for creating a computational vivarium which can simulate
colonies of cells in shared, dynamic environments.

The platform's framework is a novel synthesis of several modeling
methodologies:
1) Whole-cell modeling, to simulate hybrid models of cells with complex
internal organization.
2) Agent-based modeling, to simulate the interactions of many cells in a
shared environment.
3) Multiscale simulation, to solve problems with multiple scales of time
and space.
4) Wirable model modules, to streamline model development by decomposing
computational representations into modules that can be reconfigured and
recombined.
